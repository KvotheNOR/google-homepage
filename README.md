The object of this project is to make a website as similar as possible to the google homepage. It does not have to have the same functions.

The goal is to learn to use HTML to structure the site, and CSS to make it appear as I want.

i will be using a web browsers inspection tool as much as possible to find out what values I want and how google has structured the site. I will also use this tool to quickly change my own site without having to save and change programs.
